It's been another ~2 years since I've done a major update for these READMEs.
I figured it would be a fun exercise to refactor all of my 3 "major" personal projects and address some of the issues that I had mentioned before.
Plus it'd be a little bit of a shame to completely throw these (quite featureless) projects away.
Since I'm busy with other projects (learning DS&A, working on a 2D cyberpunk platformer etc.), it might take a while, so I'll leave the READMEs like this until I'm done refactoring/improving them.
